                                          About MovieWiki
         A web application that enables you to search for any movie and view details about it.

*Using the search bar in the homepage, you can search for a movie.
*To know details about the movie, click on the movie name.
*Next page shows the details about the movie.
*To return back to the homepage you can use the "Go back" button.

As the API provides only one movie for any search, I have done it with only one movie. Movies that have similar words are not displayed as the API does not support it.

As there is a movie named "Undefined", even if you simply open the "details.html" or "results.html", the API call retrieves the movie details.
